<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vector class handles calculations of Vectors.

An instance can be constructed from either a 1 or 2 Vertices.
new Vector ( array( "dest" => new Vertex(...) ), array( "orig" => new Vertex(...) ) );

Vertex.dox.txt tells you more about them.

Vector	magnitude();
Returns the vector's length

Vector	normalize();
Returns a normalized version of the vector. 
If the vector is already normalized, returns a fresh copy of the vector.

Vector	add( Vector $rhs );
Returns the sum vector of both vectors.

Vector	sub( Vector $rhs );
Returns the difference vector of both vectors.

Vector	opposite();
Returns the opposite vector.

Vector	scalarProduct( $k )
Returns the multiplication of the vector with a scalar.

float dotProduct( Vector $rhs )
Returns the scalar multiplication of both vectors.

float cos( Vector $rhs )
Returns the cosine of the angle between two vectors.

Vector crossProduct( Vector $rhs )
Returns the cross multiplication of both vectors (right-hand system!)
